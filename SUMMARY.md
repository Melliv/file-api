# Summary

## Comments

Acceptance Criteria was easy to understand.
Estimated working time: 7h

## Which part of the assignment took the most time and why?

OpenApi docs part took longer than I expected. First I tried to implement more flexible yaml.
It felt strange that I have to describe schemas in second time even if they are described in classes, but I couldn't
find a better way.
OpenApi was the only new part I came across. I had encountered other technologies before.

## What You learned

I reminded myself of the world of java/kotlin. It has been quite some time since I last encountered it.

## TODOs

In general, I am of the opinion that there should be only as many features as are needed.
If you do something excessively, there is a high probability that you will need to change it anyway when the need
arises, or you never need it at all.
